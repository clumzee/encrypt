# encrypt

This App can Encrypt or decrypt any given message using a certain algorithm

I Have divided files into 3 parts 
1. the encryption.py file (which contains the algorithm of encrypting any message)
2. decryption.py file (which contains the algorithm of decrypting the message)
3. app.py filw which uses streamlit library for u.i.

One thing to remember is that the decrypt funconality can only decrypt the mesaage which was encrypted by this app only.

The u.i is pretty simple and you will easily understand wha't going on behind the hood
